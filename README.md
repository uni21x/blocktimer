Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 📜 History

This project is an experiment in AI-assisted coding ("Vibecoding"):
1.  **Inception**: Created with **Codex** to build a functional prototype.
2.  **Evolution**: Refined, modernized, and polished with **Antigravity** (2026), adding a robust UI, dark mode, and fixing core logic.
